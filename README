# Unofficial SleepHQ-Pi Automation Utitilies

This is a rough and dirty log of what I'm doing to automate my SleepHQ uploads until the Magic Uploader is open-sourced.

## IDEA
	• Remove SD Card from CPAP
	• Insert SD Card into Raspberry Pi setup.
	• Script runs
		○ Copy the data off the SD Card into YEAR-MONTH-DAY-HHMMSS folder
		○ Update symlink to CURRENT-CPAP-DATA
		○ Throw a timestamp into my Dropbox
		○ Run Selenium automation to upload to SleepHQ
		○ Unmount the SD card and alert me it is safe to remove?
	• Send me a Text through Twilio/Make/IFFFT etc
		○ "CPAP Data - 2023-05-08
			 [y/n] copied off SD Card 
			 [y/n] saved to Dropbox 
             [y/n] uploaded successfully to SleepHQ"
